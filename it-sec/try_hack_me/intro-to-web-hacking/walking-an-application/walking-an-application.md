# Walking An Application

## Task 3 | Viewing The Page Source

Search through the html code and you will see a comment at the top with a endpoint to the side **'/new-home-beta'.
If you open this site you find a flag.**

In a a-tag you also find a **link to the site '/secret-page' with a flag**.

If you look from where the resources come you se that they all come from 'http://10-10-149-178.p.thmlabs.com/assets'
and if you **navigate there you find the file flag.txt** and you can open it.

On the home page you find a link to the framework page and in the 'Change Log' navigation you find a reference to the file '/tmp.zip'.
And because the page is on a old framework version we can **receive the zip with the url 'https://10-10-149-178.p.thmlabs.com/tmp.zip'**.
In the tmp.zip you fnid the file flag.txt with the flag.

In the navigation Documentation you find the page '/thm-framework-login' and the user admin and password admin.
You can now **navigate to 'https://10-10-149-178.p.thmlabs.com/thm-framework-login' and login with the user and password**.
But you dont have to input the flag anywhere on TryHackMe.

## Task 4 | Developer Tools - Inspector

On the Acme IT Support website, click into the news section, where youâ€™ll see three news articles.
The first two articles are readable, but the third has been blocked with a floating notice above the content stating you have to be a premium customer to view the article.

Inspect the page and click on the div with the class 'premium-customer-blocker' and **change the 'display: block' to 'display: none'**.
Now you see the flag.

## Task 5 | Developer Tools - Debugger

On the page '/contact' you see asset with the name flash.min.js.
You can format the code, **set a breakpoint on line 48 'flash\['remove'\]()'** and you will see the flag.

## Task 6 | Developer Tools - Network

If you send the contact form with some dummy data you will see in the **network tab that it is sent to the page 'https://10-10-149-178.p.thmlabs.com/contact-msg'.
If you navigate to this site you find a flag**.
