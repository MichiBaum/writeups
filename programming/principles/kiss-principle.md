# KISS

KISS, an acronym for "Keep it simple, stupid!", is a design principle first noted by the U.S. Navy in 1960.
The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.
