# DRY

"Don't repeat yourself" (DRY) is a principle aimed at reducing repetition of information which is likely to change, replacing it with abstractions that are less likely to change, or using data normalization which avoids redundancy in the first place.

The DRY principle is stated as "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system".
