# WET

WET, a backronym commonly taken to stand for write everything twice (alternatively write every time, we enjoy typing or waste everyone's time). WET solutions are common in multi-tiered architectures where a developer may be tasked with, for example, adding a comment field on a form in a web application. The text string "comment" might be repeated in the label, the HTML tag, in a read function name, a private variable, database DDL, queries, and so on. A [DRY](dry-principle.md) approach eliminates that redundancy by using frameworks that reduce or eliminate all those editing tasks except the most important ones, leaving the extensibility of adding new knowledge variables in one place. This conceptualization of "WET" as an alternative to "DRY" programming has been around since at least 2002 in the Java world.
