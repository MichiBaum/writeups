## Idea
Black wants to attack the king's side. White probably  closes the center and attacks on the queen's side. The idea is that if black succseeds its checkmate. If white succeeds he will probably only get a few pawns.

### Pros and cons

Pros
- Very active defense
- Black only has to knock down, not build up
- Unbalancing

Cons
- White's space advantage
- White's strong center
- Very theoretical opening
