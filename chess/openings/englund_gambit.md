## Idea


### Pros and cons
Pros
- Can catch beginners and intermediate players off-guard
- Black can win quickly if White falls for one of the opening's traps

Cons
- It's not hard to avoid the traps and get an excellent position for White
- Black's position is also strategically bad if they opt not to go for the trap lines
